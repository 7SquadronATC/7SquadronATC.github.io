# 7 Squadron Website

This is a website for the [New Zealand Cadet Forces](http://www.cadetforces.org.nz/) unit No. 7 (City of Hamilton) Squadron, Air Training Corps.

## Building

To build for production, simply run `npm run build`. This will transpile and bundle all JS and CSS into the `dist/` folder ready to serve.

For development, `npm run watch` and `npm run serve` are available to watch and serve the site respectively. `npm start` will run both these commands in parallel.
